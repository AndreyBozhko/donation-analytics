# donation-analytics
My solution to the Insight Data Engineering Coding Competition (https://github.com/InsightDataScience/donation-analytics) in Java.
The source files are compiled using a javac compiler from the package openjdk-9-jdk-headless.

The script run.sh compiles and executes the project; the two input data files are input/itcont.txt and input/percentile.txt, and the result is written into output/repeat_donors.txt.
