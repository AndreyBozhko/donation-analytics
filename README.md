My solution to the Insight Data Engineering Coding Competition (https://github.com/InsightDataScience/donation-analytics).

## Brief description
The solution is written in Java and the source files are compiled using the `javac` compiler from the package `openjdk-9-jdk-headless`.
The script `run.sh` compiles and executes the project; the two input data files are `input/itcont.txt` and `input/percentile.txt`, and the result is written into `output/repeat_donors.txt`. Running `insight_testsuite/run_tests.sh` evaluates the solution using the tests from `insight_suite/tests/`.
